GENERAL
- No hardcoding. All configs, constants, URLs, limits, and keys must be stored in config/env files.
- Follow modern best practices and current industry standards (2024+).
- Write clean, readable, maintainable code. No spaghetti, no hacks.

ARCHITECTURE
- Use clear separation of concerns.
- Split logic into reusable components, hooks, services, and utils.
- Components must be small, single-responsibility, and reusable.
- Business logic must not live inside UI components.

FRONTEND (React)
- Prefer functional components and hooks.
- Avoid large components (>200 lines).
- Use controlled state management (Context/Zustand/etc. when needed).
- No inline styles unless justified; use consistent styling approach.
- Proper folder structure (components, hooks, services, utils).

BACKEND (Express / API)
- Use layered architecture (routes → controllers → services → repositories).
- No logic in routes.
- Validate inputs and handle errors properly.
- Use async/await, no callback hell.

CODE QUALITY
- No magic numbers or strings.
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and files.
- Avoid duplication (DRY).
- Prefer composition over inheritance.

DEFAULT RULE
- If a better, cleaner, or more scalable solution exists — use it.
